Project name:
Paws-Client-Management-Portal


Project description: 
I work for a doggy daycare called Paws Pet Resort. I asked my owner/managers/supervisors if I would create them an app what would you add / need in said app.
They explained to me that most daycares have a client portal so clients can add thier own dogs and information to reduce the load for them. There system is pretty outdated and the front 
usually have to manual add and create each client info. This reduces that load for them so managment can just look up dogs based on information thier owner put. I also added a reservation table where 
clients can request a reservation(Do note that the owner said that if this website were to deploy that managment will still need to call client to confirm reservation).
